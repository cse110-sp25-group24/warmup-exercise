## Review of the Process

During this warmup exercise, our team (BeeZee24/7) worked collaboratively to build an interactive playing card UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We began with a team Zoom meeting to review the assignment, then divided into sub-teams for structure, styling, and logic. We used GitHub Issues and branching to organize and track tasks.

We successfully implemented Step 1 of the assignment: creating a styled card deck with a draw and shuffle feature. We built everything from scratch with no frameworks, which improved our understanding of vanilla JavaScript. We also created a custom layout using Flexbox and tested dynamic card updates using local SVGs. At the end of the sprint, we recorded a short demo and compiled this summary and SWOT analysis.

## SWOT Analysis

### Team

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Clear task division and strong communication in meetings | Some duplication of work (multiple teammates wrote shuffle/draw logic) |
| Everyone pushed commits and contributed across different parts of the stack | Minor Git merge conflicts due to inexperience with branches |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| More efficient with short check-ins and clear PR ownership | Risk of bottlenecks if core members are unavailable |
| Team rotation can increase skill exposure for all members | Final project will require stronger coordination if complexity increases |

---

### Tech (HTML/CSS/JS)

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Easy to understand and debug without frameworks | Took longer to build components manually |
| Fast to load, full control over layout/styling | Limited animation capabilities without extra libraries |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Build reusable Web Components for cards and deck | Manual state handling can become error-prone if scaled |
| Opportunity to add CSS transitions or flip logic later | Without animation tools, UX might feel flat |

---

### Tools (GitHub, Figma)

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| GitHub Issues helped break down tasks clearly | Some teammates were new to branching and PRs |
| Figma made the layout vision clear before coding | Not everyone used or referred to the Figma actively |
| Clear team and contribution process written in the README |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Assign Issues with clearer labels and deadlines | If PR reviews aren't enforced, code quality may suffer |
| Sync GitHub board with standups to track progress live | Conflicts may arise if teammates commit directly to main |
| We can reuse this structure (README + Slack + GitHub Issues) for future projects | Confusion or errors may occur if branch guidelines arenâ€™t followed |
| GitHub Projects or PR Templates could further improve organization |

## Summary of Our Learning

This exercise helped us practice breaking a project into manageable tasks and revealed how we work together as a team. We learned:
- How to collaboratively build a UI using only vanilla web tech
- The importance of syncing GitHub Issues with PRs to avoid duplication
- The value of Figma for aligning design early
- How to structure cards, decks, and interactivity
- How to split up work effectively in a large team using Slack and GitHub

We're more prepared for our final project now, and this warmup gave us the foundation for better collaboration, cleaner code, and faster team communication.
